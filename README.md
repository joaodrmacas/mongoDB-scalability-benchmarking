# Project Introduction

Welcome to the ESLE24-G7 project repository!

This project aims to run and test a distributed MongoDB setup with various configurations and node options, both on the cloud and locally. Our goal is to explore the performance, and scalability of MongoDB in different environments.
You may run this system **locally** or in the **cloud** using gcp. Inside each folder there's a README explaining how to deploy these.

### Project Objectives

- **Performance Testing**: Measure how different configurations affect MongoDB's speed and efficiency.
- **Scalability Experiments**: Test MongoDB's ability to scale horizontally and vertically.
